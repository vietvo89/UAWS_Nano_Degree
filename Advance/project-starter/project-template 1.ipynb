    "\n",
    "This section discusses the impact of adding additional features and changing hyperparameters on the outcomes of the Kaggle score.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding additional features:\n",
    "  - Additional features help improve the performance in general. For example,  \"year, month, day, hour\" helps improve the kaggle score from 1.8 to 0.449. \n",
    "  - However, beside new features about time, adding new features of \"peak_hour\" does not help improve. It could be this feature does not bring more useful information that may be already included in \"year, month, day, hour\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Changing hyperparameters (auto finetuning):\n",
    "  - In general, changing hyperparameters for specific models such as \"GBM,XT,XGB,NN\" help improve the kaggle score if comapred with tuning only two \"GBM,NN\". For instance, the kaggle score is improved from 0.49 to 0. 439. \n",
    "  - Nonetheless, changing hyperparameters for more models such as \"GBM,KNN,XT,XGB,RF,NN\" does not improve the kaggle score if compared with only four models \"GBM,XT,XGB,NN\". It could be due to the fact that, \"KNN, RF\" do not have high performance in this problem and changing them does not benefit at all."
